Birds is a new scooter company that wants everyone to take $1 scooter rides.  As they add more scooters stores
to their network it takes a really long time for customers to locate the scooter store that is closest to them.
Currently they have over a 10,000 scooters stores and provide 100,0000 rides every day. Resulting 1 Billion queries.

Implement a data structure that has two methods:

1. add( Node scooter)
2. closestPoint(Node location) -> Returns the closes Node corresponding to the closese scooter store
