The game of life is often won by the Nth place losers. Since the top P often burnout
and the bottom M never finish. You are tasked with writing a n algorithm that finds the Nth place loser

Given an Array of student objects that implement the compariable interface.

[ -..........-,..........-]
  ^          ^           ^
  |          |           |

Example [10, 9, 8 , 7,  6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
          ^  ^
          0  1
N = 1
