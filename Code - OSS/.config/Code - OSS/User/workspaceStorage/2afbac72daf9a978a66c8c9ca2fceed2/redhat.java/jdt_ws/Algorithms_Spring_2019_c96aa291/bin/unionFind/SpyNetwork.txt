There are N citizens in a country. Some of them are spies, while some are not.
You may assume that all citizens are spies with themselves at least.
Their spying is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct spy of B, and B is a
direct spy of C, then A is an indirect spy of C. And we defined a spy group is a group of
citizens who are direct or indirect spies.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the spy relationship between citizens in the country.
If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth citizens are direct spies with each other, otherwise not.
And you have to output the total number of spy circles among all the citizens.

Example 1:
Input:
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st citizens are direct spies, so they are in a spy group.
The 2nd citizen himself is in a spy group. So return 2.
Example 2:
Input:
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st citizens are direct spies, the 1st and 2nd citizens are direct spies,
so the 0th and 2nd citizens are indirect spies. All of them are in the same spy group, so return 1.
Note:
N is in range [1,200].
M[i][i] = 1 for all citizens.
If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.


Feel Free to use the code for lecture and book. The Union find data structure should be very helpful.
