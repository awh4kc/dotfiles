In lecture we discussed the seam carving algorithm. In this assignment you will implement the seam carving
algorithm. Your program should accept two parameters:
    1.matrix representing the image.
    2.number of seams to carve.

Your program should out the new matrix with the appropriate number of seams carved into the image.
