Please imagine a world with me.

The algorithms TAs have uncovered some information that could save the world! The only trouble is, none of us are
social media giants (I know, extremely unrealistic). In this imaginary, ludicrous world, everyone is on twitter and retweets
everything they see on twitter. In this world twitter only shows you tweets from people you follow, no ads.

We have broken down our information into k tweets. We need to find k people such that if they each tweet part of the message
everyone entire world will see and retweet that message.

To make your job easier, we have represented people as integers. Complete associated methods to help us figure out who
to contact and how to save the world. Feel free to write other methods as you need them.
